Purpose: This application is my capstone project for my Web Design Masters Program with the University of Florida. The purpose of the project is to showcase design and coding abilities that were taught over the course of the program and collate that knowledge into one application. 

Motivation: The motivation for this application was to have an application that provided information to prepare for traveling in one location. Traveling can be daunting and overwhelming, and eliminating navigating multiple resources to obtain the desired information and providing one location for that information, makes the process of preparing for a trip less overwhelming. The motivation behind the design was an old leatherbound travel journal that has notes quickly scribbled inside to reference back to.  

Build Status: Currently, that build status is a functional website that features the core elements of location search, seasonal packing lists, membership database, and additional links. There are several elements that will be added with the next version, including a previous session travel location, updated weather information on the location, and an adaptable packing list.

Code Style: The code style is still very beginner with several elements that could be reduced or simplified. Primarily the code is in html, css, javascript, and php. 

API Reference: There is one third-party API that was used for this application, REST Countries. This was used to obtain information for the location information page. Here is a link for the API: https://restcountries.com/#about-this-project-important-information
